	<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
	Since most (all for now) my presentations are done in my home country
	they're in spanish which can be confusing since most (I think all) of
	this site is in english. All that's done in spanish will have an (spa)
	flag in the title.

	<h2>Introduction to Python(spa)</h2>
	I've realized a presentation to introduce my coworkers into Python.
	Showing the basics and points of interest for our work (graphs, curve
	fitting, solving equations, etc), here are the slides of that:

	<h2>F2PY(spa)</h2>
	Since I've been fiddling a lot with <strong>f2py</strong> during my
	course of Scientific Software Design, my teacher asked me to make the
	presentation in the topic, here I explain some basics about Fortran
	and how to brige it with Python.<br>
