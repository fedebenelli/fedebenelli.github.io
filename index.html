	<h2>Who am I?</h2>
	<p class=par>
	I'm a Chemical Engineer from Argentina.
	<br>
	<br>
	I've always been interested in both Computers and Engineering, now I'm
	lucky to be able to mix both developing efficient algorithms and
	numerical methods for the thermodynamic modelling and PVT simulation of
	reservoir fluids. Packaging them in useful tools for my research group
	at <a href="https://ipqa.unc.edu.ar">IPQA</a> and also for their
	implementation in fully-fledges software.
	<br>
	<br>
	I also have done R+D in the department of Organic Chemistry of my
	college and at <a href="https://ceprocor.cba.gov.ar/">CEPROCOR</a>. You
	can check more about it at <a href="research/rsrch.html">Research</a>!

	<h2>My computer</h2> 
	<p class=par>
	Right now I'm using Arch Linux as my main OS with some personal
	scripts.<br>
	</p>
	<p class=par>
	<h3>My Hardware</h3> 
	<h4>Main PC</h4>
	<ul> 
	<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600</li>
	<li>GPU: Nvidia GTX 960</li>
	<li>RAM: 16GB DDR3</li> 
	<li>Keyboard: Redragon Kumara</li>
	<li>Mouse: Steelseries Rival 300</li>
	</ul> 
	<h4> Second PC </h4>
	I also use a Lenovo ThinkPad T420 (actually this one is the 
	one I mostly use for work) running Artix Linux, I keep 
	both computers's home folders rsynced so most of the time is
	almost as I'm using always the same PC. (This laptop dieded, now I use
    a Thinkpad L14gen1)
