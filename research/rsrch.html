		<h2>CEPROCOR</h2>
		<p class="par">
		At CEPROCOR, i've been doing R&D in multiple topics, mostly
		based on extraction and purification of natural compounds.

		<ul>
		<li>Optimization of Soy's Isoflavones extraction</li>
		<li>Extraction of Rosemary's Carnosic Acid</li>
		<li>Modelling and design of an extraction and purifaction
			process</li>
		</ul>

		<h2> Organic Chemistry </h2>
		<p class"par">
		Before that, I've been a research helper for two years at the
		Organic Chemistry department, where I helped with lab classes
		but also did some research developing a technique for the
		determination of amilose in diverse kinds of starches. 
		<br>
		There I developed a C# software to adjust the experimental data
		to an equation that helps with the determination.
